## Welcome to the NFT API

The NFT API provides endpoints for retrieving any collection and NFT in existence, as well as transfers, owners, sales, and much more (fully supports both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs).

## Endpoints
The **NFT API** supports the following groups of endpoints:

1. **Collection Endpoints**: Retrieve any NFT collection using flexible queries, along with collection metadata and images.

2. **NFT Endpoints**: Retrieve any NFT in existence and rich NFT metadata and media, by date minted, collection, owner, and more.

3. **Owner Endpoints**: Retrieve all owners for a particular collection or NFT (supports fungible balances for ERC-1155s)

4. **Sale Endpoints**: Retrieve any NFT sale given an account, collection, or date range across many decentralized exchanges.

5. **Transfer Endpoints**: Retrieve all transfers, including mints, sends, and burns, for any collection, NFT, or individual account.
