# Playground

The SQL Playground and Atlas are environments built for exploring, testing and organizing queries against the entirety of Transpose data.

## Playground to production code
Transferring queries from the Playground to your code couldn't be easier. Simply click the "view code" button, select the right environment and you can copy it right in! Note that your API key will also be copied.


## Publishing to the Atlas
There are two options for saving queries:
1. Save privately: available just to you, visible in your query browser bar in the playground.
2. Publish to Atlas: visible to everyone in the Atlas, also visible to you under published queries in the playground.


## Using the query planner
The `Analyze` button returns the results of the query planner for the query in your editor. You can use this to check whether your queries are running against indexes. To see what indexes exist on each table, check out the SQL models to the left.


## Downloading data in the browser
You can download the results of a query directly from the playground using the download button.
