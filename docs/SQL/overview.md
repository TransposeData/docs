# Overview

## Welcome to the Transpose SQL API
Transpose offers direct SQL access to our entire ecosystem of indexed blockchain data. Paired with our robust indexing pipeline, SQL access gives unlimited flexibility in how you mix, aggregate, and query activity across the blockchain. 

Writing your own complex SQL queries with joins and subqueries can be tricky — that’s why we’re also releasing *The Transpose Atlas*, a way for you to share and explore SQL queries that optimally achieve your goals. Read on to see how direct access to Transpose SQL can redefine the way you search, build, and analyze in web3. 

## The Playground
Greater query flexibility often means more complexity for end-users, especially when SQL is in the mix. That’s why we’re creating a unified experience for writing, testing, sharing and exploring Transpose SQL queries. We’re calling this place *The Playground* — an environment built from the ground up to optimize the discovery of new views of blockchain data.

## The Atlas
Being able to share your favorite queries and use those created by the community unlocks the true potential of direct SQL access to Transpose. The Atlas will allow everyone to contribute to and explore the most powerful queries we enable — smart floor prices for NFTs, historical token balances for a wallet, lookups against NFT metadata traits, upcoming ENS name expirations, and much, much more. The only limit is your creativity.
