## Welcome to the Block API

The Block API provides endpoints for accessing low-level blockchain data at scale, including accounts, blocks, transactions, and logs.

## Endpoints
The **Block API** supports the following groups of endpoints:

1. **Account Endpoints**: Retrieve any account, including both externally-owned accounts and smart contracts, along with essential account metadata.

2. **Block Endpoints**: Retrieve every block in existence with smart fee calculations and flexible query parameters.

3. **Transaction Endpoints**: Retrieve every transaction ever created with powerful query parameters that let you filter by block number, transaction hash, involved addresses, transfer value, target contract, target contract method, and more.

4. **Log Endpoints**: Retrieve and filter all historical logs by account, topic, contract, and much more.
