# Welcome to the Token API

The **Token API** provides endpoints for retrieving any token, token balance, transfer, and symbol in existence, including full support for native token transfers and balances (fully supports both ERC-20 and ERC-777 tokens).

## Endpoints
The **Token API** supports the following groups of endpoints:

1. Token Info Endpoints: Retrieve any token ever created using flexible queries, along with token metadata and symbols.

2. Owner Endpoints: Retrieve all owners and owner balances for a token (ordered by balance).

3. Transfer Endpoints: Retrieve all transfers, including mints, sends, and burns, for any token or individual account.

4. Swap Endpoints: Retrieve all swaps for any token, account, or date range across all decentralized exchanges.

5. Native Token Endpoints: Retrieve historical native token transfers and balances for any account or time range.
