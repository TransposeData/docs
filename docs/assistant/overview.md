# AI Query Assistant Overview

Writing SQL queries can be challenging, even for expert data scientists.  That's why we created the AI Query Assistant, a tool that takes the hard work out of creating, optimizing, and debugging your SQL queries.

The Query Assistant is available in the Transpose Playground, and can be accessed by clicking the "AI Query Assistant" button in the top right corner of the SQL editor.

## Notes

### Billing

The Query Assistant charges a small number of credits for each query that it generates.  The number of credits charged depends on the length of the predicted query, but is typically less than or equal to 64 credits per request.

### Known limitations

Currently the Query Assistant supports all of Ethereum mainnet.  We're working on bringing support to our other supported chains as soon as possible.
