# Overview

## Welcome to Transpose Custom Endpoints

Transpose Custom Endpoints are customized REST endpoints that you can create, version, and use directly in your production applications.

Behind the scenes, Custom Endpoints use Transpose's hyper-performant data infrastructure to return exactly the data you need, in milliseconds.

## Why Custom Endpoints?
Custom endpoints provide a modular, production-ready infrastructure to build and scale serious applications. Compared with running SQL queries through our SQL API, Endpoints provide a versioned, consistent framework for confidently ingesting data at scale. Endpoints abstract the complexity of SQL in your production database and allow for simpler integration in production. 

Gone are the days of maintaining SQL alongside business logic. With endpoints, your team can collaborate to maintain strictly versioned and performant checkpoints of queries written internally, by our team or our community.
