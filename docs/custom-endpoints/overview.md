# Overview

## Welcome to Transpose Custom Endpoints

Well-defined backend data endpoints are critical to the development process of any production application.

Custom Endpoints allow you to rapidly build and version control high-performance production-ready APIs that are perfectly suited to your specific needs.  This lets you build faster and more confidently, while focusing engineering effort onto what matters most: your application.

Under the hood, Custom Endpoints use Transpose's hyper-performant query infrastructure to return the data you need in milliseconds.  As such, you can use any valid Transpose SQL query in order to build your endpoint.
