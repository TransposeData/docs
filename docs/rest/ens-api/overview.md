## Welcome to the ENS API

The ENS API provides endpoints for looking up ENS names (both historical and primary), resolving ENS names and records, and monitoring ENS transfers and sales.

## Endpoints
The **ENS API** supports the following groups of endpoints:

1. **Record Endpoints**: Retrieve any ENS record ever created by account, owner, name, node, registration date, expiration date and more.

2. **Transfer Endpoints**: Retrieve all historical and live ENS name transfers and registrations.
