# Community Endpoints

With the Atlas, you can share endpoints that you create with the community.  You can also search for endpoints that others have created, and easily use them in your own application.

## Use an Endpoint from the Community

The Atlas makes finding queries from the community trivial, and hundreds of endpoints are already available for you to use.

For example, let's say that you're building a financial analysis tool, and looking to obtain [OHLC (open, high, low, close) bars](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/ohlcchart.asp) for a particular historical token price.  You can search for "OHLC" in the Atlas, and you'll see a number of endpoints that you can use for exactly this purpose.  No need to build custom logic for yourself; Transpose and the community have you covered.

Once you've opened this query in the Playground, you can follow the [instructions here](/custom-endpoints/create) to deploy this query as a custom endpoint, and immediately start using it in your project.
